// THE ADVISOR LIGHTS THE REAL CONTROL ON SETUP (the owner, 2026-10-19: "update the advisor and make it work on setup. Make sure it's

// show, and - on a fresh home - lighting ChatGPT (the shelf's first) beside a Claude card that read "Connected - pick it to make it your
// AI". The move is the card itself, or the open card's own button, or the row's Next - never a button of the Advisor's own.
